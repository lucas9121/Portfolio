                        <p>Iâ€™m a software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and building functional web applications. With a background in both the criminal justice and education fields, I bring a unique perspective to software engineering and a commitment to creating solutions that help people. </p>
                        <p>I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I'm skilled in building dynamic and interactive web applications that provide users with a seamless experience. I'm also proficient in back-end web development technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, which enables me to build and manage databases and create robust, scalable web applications.
                            As a problem-solver at heart, I enjoy taking on new challenges and finding creative solutions to complex problems. Whether it's building a feature-rich web application or optimizing code for maximum efficiency, I'm always striving to learn and improve my skills. 
                        </p>
                        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me playing the piano or video games, or volunteering for causes I'm passionate about. I believe that a well-rounded individual is an asset in any workplace, and I bring that same level of dedication and passion to my work as a software engineer.</p>
                        <p>If you're looking for a skilled and motivated software engineer who is committed to creating functional and user-friendly web applications, I'd love to talk to you about how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.</p>
